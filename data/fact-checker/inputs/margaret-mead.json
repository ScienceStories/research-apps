  "passage": "Margaret Mead was an American anthropologist. An anthropologist is someone who studies human beings and their cultures. Mead is best known for her studies of the peoples of Oceania. Over many decades, she earned a reputation as one of the foremost anthropologists of the 1900s.\n\nMead was born on December 16, 1901, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her father was an economics professor, and her mother was dedicated to the women’s rights movement. Mead graduated from college with a degree in psychology in 1923. She then entered graduate school at Columbia University in New York City. One of her teachers was Franz Boas, one of the founders of modern anthropology. Mead received an M.A. in 1924 and a Ph.D. in 1929.\n\nMead’s first book, Coming of Age in Samoa, was based on her field work among female adolescents in Samoa. The book became a best seller and has remained in print since 1928. Mead continued to write about her observations of people in Oceania into the 1960s. Mead worked at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City from 1926 to 1969 as a curator of cultural anthropology. She also taught at Columbia University.\n\nMead became a popular and controversial speaker on such issues as women’s rights, child rearing, drug abuse, and world hunger. She was elected president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Mead died on November 15, 1978, in New York City. In 1979 she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom (the highest nonmilitary award in the United States).",
